%   function index = SOFAfindPosition(Obj,azimuth_target,elevation_target)
%
%   This function outputs the index of a HRIR in a SOFA file (of type 
%   'SimpleFreeFieldHRIR') that is the closest to a desired incoming 
%   direction described in spherical coordinates (the distance is
%   voluntarily discarded).
%
%   Note if azimuth_target is an empty array, SOFAfindPosition() returns
%   the index of all the HRIRs whose elevation angle is the closest
%   available to the desired elevation angle (iso-elevation set of
%   positions, no matter of the azimuth angle).
